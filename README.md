# cleaning
This repo has changed from its inception. At first the idea was to take messy data and clean them up but it ended up being more focused on Machine Learning. 
The data is still checked and clean but its focus on utilizing data from UCIML to clean and then apply various ML methods to produce "realistic" accuracy.
